		<h3><strong>Project</strong> <span> Overview</span></h3>
        <p>
            The Biofinity Project focuses on the development of a software framework that supports biodiversity and
            genomics research by relating data of participating labs with those of larger, public databases. It also
            gives users access to data search, browsing, and analysis tools that are fully integrated with the
            interface. Our efforts have resulted in the creation of a single-source, web-enabled interface to all
            aspects of the framework that allows users to interact with data from diverse sources as if they were
            from a single provider. The unification of many disparate, existing data sources provides community
            support for independent research activities while encouraging data sharing and collaboration. The
            Biofinity Project includes data management workflows that allow users to easily manipulate data in a
            standard format, allowing it to be readily published and shared as part of the data sets that are
            federated by the system. The workflows not only provide data management functionality, but also give
            users access to analytical tools through the same common web-enabled data set. Users can run standard
            bioinformatics tools on both private and public data sets, benefiting from the data integration
            components of the system. This allows users access to data sets significantly larger than what could
            be generally maintained in a local lab environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Considerable progress has been made in building the software framework and identifying partners to
            contribute data sets for integration. The most recent major update provides users with management
            tools for interacting with the data, and includes the following high-level features:
            <ul class="para-list">
                <li>
                    A data management service called My Labs, which allows users to upload existing databases
                    into the framework for management, archiving, and interaction. Data are maintained in a
                    secure, private store with access control management, allowing only specific users the
                    ability to access the data. The My Labs feature allows researchers in independent labs to
                    utilize the integrated data and work with their own private data from a single interface,
                    taking the burden of data management off researchers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Classification tools for taxonomists that are integrated into the vast species database
                    provided by The Biofinity Project. Using these tools, taxonomists can create, manage and
                    manipulate classifications that then can be applied to specimen data in My Labs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mobile applications for field researchers. With The Biofinity Project Mobile, field users can
                    easily access My Labs data from their iPhone, uploading and geo-coding specimen data and
                    images while still in the field. Data are available in My Labs immediately for researchers to
                    access in the lab.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spatial workflow extensions that allow researchers to perform spatial analysis on data in
                    public and My Labs databases. The Biofinity Project software framework incorporates spatial
                    analysis functionality like occurrence distribution, cluster analysis, as well as several
                    environmental data sets. The Biofinity Project web application exposes this functionality
                    through integration with the Google Maps technology, allowing users to transparently interact
                    with robust GIS technologies.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, we are presently developing
            other features to continue to improve and broaden the capabilities of the Biofinity Project, including an
            intelligent user interface to support collaborative research and to facilitate more effective data
            processing and dissemination.  Also in progress is an ontological representation of the data to help
            federate overlapping databases and allow for automated reasoning about the data.
