			<h2>Create a new lab</h2>
			<p>If you are currently managing a database of biological data and would
			like to begin to use My Labs by The Biofinity Project to manage data, you should
			register your organization as a lab.  The following forms will guide you through
			this process.  There will be a several day delay between submission and approval
			for your lab request as members of our team verify your organization and create
			a new lab for you.</p>

			<h2>Join an existing lab</h2>
			<p>If you are working with a group that has already registered a lab with 
			The Biofinity Project, you can request to join the
			lab and begin to collaborate with researchers.  The following forms will 
			guide you through the process of registering your account and requesting
			access to the existing lab.  There may be a delay as the manager of the lab
			reviews your request and processes the approval.</p>
